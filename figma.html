        <p>
            "Stocked & Stacked" is an innovative mobile app designed to transform kitchen inventory management and meal planning. 
            Users can effortlessly input and monitor grocery items via manual input or barcode scanning, facilitating accurate real-time 
            inventory tracking. This real-time data empowers users to optimize meal planning, determine the number of possible meals with 
            available ingredients, and monitor the nutritional content of their recipes and meals. "Stocked & Stacked" fills a market void 
            by amalgamating inventory management, meal planning, and nutritional tracking. This comprehensive approach not only promotes 
            efficient grocery utilization and healthier eating but also significantly reduces food wastage, offering both economic and environmental 
            advantages. 
            <br>
            The process I will be describing is the meal plan creation feature. UUsers can craft a meal plan and, within it, design meals 
            by specifying ingredients and the desired number of servings. As users set the servings, 
            the app intuitively adjusts the ingredient quantities to match the chosen meal count.

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 1: Project Initiation</h3>
                <p>
                    The project's inception was rooted in a school assignment. While I was inclined towards the 
                    fitness and wellness domain, I recognized the saturation of apps that either focus on nutrition 
                    tracking or gym progress monitoring. To differentiate and delve deeper into the wellness sphere, 
                    I decided to enhance the nutrition tracking concept. Instead of merely tracking the nutrition 
                    of individual ingredients, I envisioned an app that could plan and track entire meals. My aim was 
                    to offer a seamless user experience, which led to the integration of an ingredient input feature that 
                    simultaneously manages inventory. Recognizing the utility of a grocery list, I incorporated it, 
                    ensuring that users could effortlessly transition from grocery shopping to inventory management 
                    and meal preparation, all within a single platform.

            <li>
                <h3>Step 2: Requirement Gathering</h3>
                <p>
                    To gather the project requirements, I prioritized user customization. I envisioned a platform where 
                    users could craft meal plans with personalized names and have the flexibility to modify them later 
                    through an edit feature. Given the app's focus on wellness and nutrition, it was imperative to incorporate 
                    detailed nutritional information. I also wanted to empower users with the ability to set their desired servings. 
                    This choice would not only adjust the ingredient inventory, reflecting how much of each item they have left, 
                    but also modify the nutritional facts accordingly. By integrating these features, the app ensures users can 
                    optimize their ingredients, determining the maximum servings they can produce for a meal.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 3: Design and Planning</h3>
                <p>In the design and planning phase, I aimed for a streamlined and uncluttered user interface. I settled on a 
                    structure that includes a home page, grocery list page, inventory page, meal prep page, and a profile page, 
                    all easily navigable through a dedicated navbar. The meal prep page was designed to be hierarchical: users 
                    can create overarching meal plans, and within these plans, they can add, edit, or view individual meals. 
                    Delving deeper into the meal screen, users have the capability to incorporate ingredients and specify servings. 
                    To design the app's components, I leveraged Figma and utilized design kits from the community, notably the 
                    Material UI kit and an iOS kit.</p>

        <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Challenge 1: [Describe the Challenge]</h3>
                <p>One significant challenge I encountered during the project was establishing the right aesthetics, 
                    particularly in terms of color scheme and typography. I grappled with selecting colors that resonated 
                    with the app's purpose and ethos, and while I've made choices, I remain open to revisions. 
                    Typography presented a similar dilemma; I aimed for a modern look without compromising readability. 
                    Customizing components from the Figma design kits added another layer of complexity, given the initial 
                    learning curve associated with Figma. To navigate these challenges, I adopted a trial-and-error approach. 
                    I experimented with various colors and typefaces within my components until I achieved a satisfactory look. As I
                     spent more time developing my design system, my proficiency with Figma grew, enabling me to tailor the components 
                     more closely to my vision.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Challenge 2: [Describe the Challenge]</h3>
                <p>Another challenge arose when I began assembling my components to visualize the overall page layouts. 
                    It was during this phase that I identified gaps in the user experience, notably the omission of a mechanism 
                    to input meal information, such as ingredients. This oversight was a remnant from an earlier stage where I had 
                    sketched initial mockups. My initial vision was for meals to have an expandable drawer-like interface that would 
                    display ingredients. However, this design didn't provide a clear pathway for users to actually input the ingredients. 
                    To address this, I revisited my mockups, rethinking the user journey for adding a meal. After several iterations and 
                    redesigns, I crafted the necessary components and assembled pages to ensure a seamless and intuitive process for users.</p>
            </li>
            <!-- Add more challenges and solutions as needed -->
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The "Stocked & Stacked" app was initiated as part of a 
            school project to enhance the wellness sector's offerings. Recognizing the saturation of 
            traditional nutrition trackers, the meal prep feature was designed to allow users to plan and monitor entire meals. 
            With a user-centric design, the interface facilitates the creation and customization of meal plans, 
            ensuring an intuitive experience. Challenges, such as component layout and user input mechanisms, 
            were addressed through iterative design. The outcome is a specialized meal prep tool that stands out, 
            offering users a unique way to optimize and track their meals.     
            
            <br>
            One of the most valuable insights I gained from this project was the importance of iterative design. 
            The process taught me that initial concepts, while foundational, often require refinement and adaptation 
            as challenges arise and new perspectives are considered. Looking ahead, I envision enhancing the app's visual appeal. 
            My aim is to evolve its design to be sleeker, ensuring that the user experience is not just functional but 
            also aesthetically pleasing. This will involve a deeper dive into design principles and possibly integrating 
            feedback from users to achieve a more refined and satisfying aesthetic.
