            <h3>#WordJournal </h3>
            <h4>Affordances & Signifiers II</h4>
            <p>
                The section I will be referring to is called "Falsely Blaming Yourself" from pages 65-68.
                <br>

                <strong>Accommodate</strong><br>

                I chose the word "accommodate" because this section brings to light the issue of humans
                adjusting to
                machines without receiving the same accommodation in return. Interacting with machines does
                not always proceed as seamlessly as one might anticipate.
                Therefore, it is essential to anticipate inappropriate actions by the user. As a future
                software engineer, it is important to
                acknowledge that users cannot be expected to achieve flawless mastery over a system or
                software, as they aren't the ones who designed it.
                By leveraging insights gained from user testing, software engineers can fine-tune their
                creations to align with user expectations,
                making use of techniques such as affordances, signifiers, effective mapping, and
                well-defined constraints. This iterative process not only
                enhances user satisfaction but also strengthens the bridge between human and machine
                interaction, fostering a more harmonious user experience.
                Having this awareness will help serve as a driving force for my growth as a software
                engineer.
