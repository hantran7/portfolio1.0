        <p>The UIUN Summit was an event where teams representing different user populations discussed and proposed
            changes to improve the accessibility of a website. Each team explored how their user group experienced the
            world, identified their specific needs, and suggested strategies for interface designers to meet those
            needs. The summit encouraged collaboration and negotiation among teams with potentially overlapping or
            conflicting requirements for website design. Each team presented their findings and recommendations, and the
            goal was to enhance UI/UX accessibility for diverse user populations. <br><br>
            Baby Boomers, who experienced a world transitioning to digital technology, value face-to-face interactions
            but have adapted to basic tech. They require clear and simple interfaces, larger text, guided steps, and
            easily accessible help options. Interestingly, these needs align with various other user groups, including
            children under 13, individuals with dyslexia, non-native speakers, photosensitive users, people with
            intellectual disabilities, those from rural communities, people with anxiety, and individuals with
            trauma/PTSD, who also benefit from clear interfaces and larger text. Design strategies for these needs
            involve familiar icons, decluttered designs, and feedback mechanisms. For the mail-in ballot interface,
            concise instructions in plain language, clear calls to action, and legible text in recommended font sizes
            and common typefaces are vital for meeting these accessibility requirements. <br><br>
            During the UIUN Summit negotiations, my focus was on advocating for a user-friendly interface with visual
            guides, large fonts, and easily accessible activation areas for Baby Boomers. Surprisingly, I found common
            ground with other groups as their requirements often overlapped with mine, emphasizing clear and simple
            interfaces, larger text, and user-friendly elements. There were no unlikely allies, but convincing the
            color-blind group was the most challenging, mainly because their requirements aligned more closely with
            standard best practices, while I was advocating for additional, population-specific requirements.
            Ultimately, we reached a compromise recognizing the benefits of inclusive design for all users. Prioritizing
            certain needs felt balanced, as the prioritized requirements were comprehensive and beneficial for Baby
            Boomers and others, resulting in a collaborative effort to ensure a more inclusive user experience.
            My greatest takeaway from the Summit was the realization that inclusive design doesn't have to be a daunting
            task. Through open and collaborative discussions, we were able to identify common needs across different
            user populations and find ways to meet those needs effectively. The experience showed me that inclusivity is
            achievable when we prioritize understanding and accommodating diverse user requirements. <br><br>
            I plan to apply these insights to other topics, especially in my work as a software engineer for apps and
            websites. Before the Summit, I had some uncertainty about how to approach inclusive design. However, now I
            understand that it involves integrating standard UI design best practices while considering features that
            can benefit specific user groups. I've learned the importance of empathy and flexibility in design, ensuring
            that the end product caters to a wide range of users. This experience has equipped me with a valuable skill
            set that I will carry forward to create more accessible and user-friendly digital experiences in the future.
