            <h3>Finding Inspiration</h3>
            <h4>Sand Spit</h4>
            <p>
                "Sand Spit" is a captivating oil on canvas painting created in 1957 by the renowned artist
                Milton Avery.
                Avery, recognized as America's leading colorist during his time, relocated to the New York
                City in 1925.
                In this artistic hub, he collaborated with and drew inspiration from notable painters such
                as Robert Henri, John Sloan, and Edward Hopper.
                In "Sand Spit," Avery's distinctive style is evident, with a focus on the relationships
                between forms and colors rather than detailed realism.
                Using a minimalist palette of about four colors, the painting portrays a tranquil seascape
                where a lush field converges with a prominent expanse
                of white spume. This piece reflects a phase in Avery's artistic journey when he gravitated
                towards landscapes and simplified interiors.
                Bridging European modernism and American Abstract Expressionism, "Sand Spit" encapsulates
                Avery's pioneering approach to art, where the
                essence of color overshadowed intricate detail.
                <br><br>
            <h4>Composition and Flow:</h4>
            <p>The composition of "Sand Spit" is structured in layers, each representing a different
                element of the coastal landscape. The transition from the sky to the pastures, then to the
                spume and sandy path, and finally to the water, creates a sense of depth and perspective.
                This layered approach guides the viewer's gaze through the painting, offering a journey from
                the expansive sky to the tranquil water below.</p>
            <h4>Color Balance</h4>
            <p>"Sand Spit" displays a harmonious blend of colors: the light blue of the sky, a lighter green
                pasture interspersed with patches of darker green, the dominant white of the spume, the
                sandy beige of the path, and the brighter shade of blue for the water.
                Avery's expertise as a colorist shines through in the way these colors come together to
                evoke the ambiance of a coastal landscape.</p>
            <h4>Texture and Detail:</h4>
            <p>The presence of darker green patches within the lighter green pasture adds a sense of texture
                and depth to the painting. While they may resemble bushes, their abstract nature leaves room
                for interpretation, allowing viewers to engage with the painting and form their own
                perceptions. These subtle variations in color and form enrich the landscape, inviting a
                deeper exploration and appreciation of Avery's artistic nuances.</p>

            <h4>My inspired UI:</h4>
            <img src="images/oceanom.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
            <p> The UI is a screen from the "Ocean Om" app, designed with a calming oceanic theme. The top
                of the screen features the "Ocean Om" logo in a soothing light blue, followed by a darker
                blue header labeled "Meditation Station". Beneath this header, there's a beige sandy-colored
                section titled "Choose Soundscape", where users can select their preferred oceanic sounds
                from a menu. Further down, there's a vibrant green button labeled "Start Meditation",
                inviting users to begin their meditative journey. The bottom of the screen has a blue app
                bar, and the entire background of the app is adorned with serene blue ocean waves,
                encapsulating the user in a tranquil maritime ambiance. The UI is intended for mobile
                devices, such as smartphones and tablets.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The inspiration for this UI sketch is drawn from the tranquil and layered visuals of the
                "Sand Spit" painting by Milton Avery. The color palette, with its gradation from light blue
                to sandy beige and then to vibrant green, mirrors the layered colors of the painting. The
                ocean waves background further immerses users in a calming coastal environment, reminiscent
                of the serene seascape depicted in "Sand Spit". The design aims to transport users to a
                peaceful oceanic realm, facilitating a deeper and more connected meditation experience.</p>
