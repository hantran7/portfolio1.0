                Typography is pivotal in design, often making up to 90% of a screen's content. When
                selecting typefaces,
                it's vital to balance brand identity, on-screen clarity, and performance, sometimes opting
                for system-native
                fonts for speed. The choice of font weights and styles should focus on clear hierarchies,
                minimizing variations
                for efficiency. Font sizes and line-heights, typically starting with a 1.5x ratio, are
                intertwined and play a
                role in the design's overall grid, needing adaptability across devices. It's essential to
                encode these typographic
                elements systematically for ease of maintenance and responsiveness.

                MyRed's user interface (UI) is a good example of effective typography in web design.
                The platform establishes a clear typographical hierarchy, with each section introduced by
                well-proportioned headers.
                Notably, these headers utilize a readable typeface that contrasts with the content typeface,
                effectively distinguishing between headers and content for improved clarity and emphasis.
                The content itself employs another readable typeface, ensuring legibility. Furthermore,
                MyRed's typography
                is adaptable, showing consistent responsiveness across different device sizes. In essence,
                MyRed's
                design balances aesthetics with user-centric functionality through its thoughtful
                typographical choices.
