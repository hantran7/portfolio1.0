                <strong>Advice</strong><br>

                I chose the word "advice" because the article emphasizes the use of the word "advice" over
                "feedback"
                due to the negative connotations commonly associated with the latter. Most people tend to
                associate feedback
                with criticism, which can make both giving and receiving feedback uncomfortable. By asking
                for advice instead
                of feedback, it is perceived as an invitation, signaling that the advice giver has valuable
                expertise or knowledge,
                making the interaction more positive and constructive. This subtle shift in terminology can
                foster a more open and
                collaborative environment, where team members feel more comfortable sharing their insights
                and suggestions,
                ultimately contributing to the professional growth of individuals and the improvement of
                design outcomes.

                As a future software engineer, it is important to understand that feedback and advice are
                crucial in this field
                for fostering innovation and continuous improvement in this fast-paced field. They
                facilitate collaboration and
                knowledge exchange, which are essential for creating optimal solutions. Additionally, they
                are
                instrumental in aiding professional development and skill refinement, contributing to career
                advancement and
                organizational growth.
