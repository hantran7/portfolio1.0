                    Creating a Design System is like building a Lego set, and designing software is like
                    constructing a city with those Lego pieces.
                </strong><br>

                Creating a Design System is like building a Lego set, offering standardized pieces and
                blueprints for construction.
                These pieces, much like UI components in a design system, ensure consistency and efficiency.
                When designing software,
                these standardized components are assembled in various configurations, similar to
                constructing diverse structures in a
                Lego city. While each construction or software application can be unique, the underlying
                design system or Lego set
                provides a unified theme, allowing for scalability and collaborative efforts. In essence, a
                design system lays the
                foundation, and designing software is the creative assembly of those foundational elements.
                <br><br>
                As a future software engineer, grasping the interconnected relationship between design
                systems and designing
                software is crucial. A design system serves as a comprehensive guide, complete with reusable
                components, styles,
                and patterns, much like foundational building blocks. When I set out to design software,
                this system equips me with a
                toolbox that ensures consistency, efficiency, and a harmonized user experience.
