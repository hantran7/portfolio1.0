								<h4>Design System Workshop</h4>
								<p>
									
									<strong>
										Creating a Design System is like building a Lego set, and designing software is like constructing a city with those Lego pieces.
									</strong><br>
									
									Creating a Design System is like building a Lego set, offering standardized pieces and blueprints for construction. 
									These pieces, much like UI components in a design system, ensure consistency and efficiency. When designing software, 
									these standardized components are assembled in various configurations, similar to constructing diverse structures in a 
									Lego city. While each construction or software application can be unique, the underlying design system or Lego set 
									provides a unified theme, allowing for scalability and collaborative efforts. In essence, a design system lays the 
									foundation, and designing software is the creative assembly of those foundational elements.
									<br><br>
									As a future software engineer, grasping the interconnected relationship between design systems and designing 
									software is crucial. A design system serves as a comprehensive guide, complete with reusable components, styles, 
									and patterns, much like foundational building blocks. When I set out to design software, this system equips me with a 
									toolbox that ensures consistency, efficiency, and a harmonized user experience.

								<h3>#DirectedAnalysis </h3>
								<h4>Design Systems</h4>
								<p>

									Typography is pivotal in design, often making up to 90% of a screen's content. When selecting typefaces, 
									it's vital to balance brand identity, on-screen clarity, and performance, sometimes opting for system-native 
									fonts for speed. The choice of font weights and styles should focus on clear hierarchies, minimizing variations 
									for efficiency. Font sizes and line-heights, typically starting with a 1.5x ratio, are intertwined and play a 
									role in the design's overall grid, needing adaptability across devices. It's essential to encode these typographic 
									elements systematically for ease of maintenance and responsiveness.
								</p>
								<img src="images/myred.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
								<p>
									MyRed's user interface (UI) is a good example of effective typography in web design. 
									The platform establishes a clear typographical hierarchy, with each section introduced by well-proportioned headers. 
									Notably, these headers utilize a readable typeface that contrasts with the content typeface, 
									effectively distinguishing between headers and content for improved clarity and emphasis. 
									The content itself employs another readable typeface, ensuring legibility. Furthermore, MyRed's typography 
									is adaptable, showing consistent responsiveness across different device sizes. In essence, MyRed's 
									design balances aesthetics with user-centric functionality through its thoughtful typographical choices.

								<h3>Color Study</h3>
								<p>
									I undertook the task of analyzing the color scheme of a specific UI: the Campus Cash app, designed to provide students with coupon offers. 
									My initial step involved recreating the UI, preserving its original color palette to clearly highlight the functionality associated
									 with each hue. My goal was to enhance the effectiveness of the design by consolidating more content within a singular screen size. 
									 Following this, I crafted three additional versions, each with a unique color scheme. The most demanding aspect of this exercise was 
									 striving for a balance between aesthetic appeal and clear distinction between interface elements. Concluding the project, I performed 
									 a detailed analysis of each proposed color arrangement. Below are the results of this exercise.
								</p>
								<h4>This is a page from the Campus Cash app, which is an app with coupons for students.</h4>
								<img src="images/campuscash.png" style="width: 20%; height: auto;">
								<p>The app’s theme is monochromatic. It uses different shades of green. The blend of green shades imparts a harmonious feel, as the hues complement one another 
									and aid in distinguishing between different elements. Because of its monochromatic theme, the app might pose accessibility challenges. 
									Monochromatic color schemes, while aesthetically appealing, can sometimes lead to insufficient contrast between different design elements.
									 Users with visual impairments, especially those with color vision deficiencies, might find it difficult to distinguish between various parts of the interface. 
									 This can impact not only the readability of the text but also the user's ability to identify actionable items. I believe the designers were trying to make a 
									 simple app that is intuitive and straight forward for college students. The decision to use green might have multiple reasons behind it; green often symbolizes growth, 
									 and renewal. It can also be associated with financial wellness or eco-friendliness, which fits with the purpose of the app.
								</p>
								<img src="images/pinkcc.png" style="width: 20%; height: auto;">
								<p>
									This iteration of the UI employs a near split-complementary color scheme, featuring a red-purple hue (resulting in a pinkish tone), orange, and green. 
									The UI boasts a calming pastel backdrop, setting a welcoming atmosphere. Dominating this is the orange app bar, 
									infusing the design with enthusiasm. Orange's liveliness keeps users engaged amidst the soothing background. 
									The dark pine green logo anchors the interface, conveying stability and depth. Its richness contrasts with the energetic orange, 
									ensuring balance. Strategically, the logo foregrounds the brand's reliability. Together, the colors harmonize tranquility 
									with dynamism, crafting a refreshing yet grounded design.
								</p>
								<img src="images/neutralcc.png" style="width: 20%; height: auto;">
								<p>
									Although the this redesigned UI does not fit into a harmonious combination, it features a serene pastel blue app bar, 
									exuding calm and clarity. This shade fosters a user-friendly ambiance. Contrasting this is the dark tan, lending an earthy, 
									stable foundation to the interface. Its neutrality anchors the design without overwhelming. The bright orange logo stands out, 
									adding a splash of vitality and enthusiasm. Collectively, 
									this palette melds soft sophistication with energetic vibrancy, crafting an inviting design.
								</p>
								<img src="images/tealcc.png" style="width: 20%; height: auto;">
								<p>This iteration of the UI closely aligns with a split-complementary color scheme, incorporating shades of blue-green, blue-purple, and red-orange.
									The bright blue-green background offers a refreshing and invigorating base, capturing attention and evoking feelings of growth and creativity. 
									This vibrancy likely resonates with the energetic nature of college students. The bluish-purple app bar contrasts beautifully, serving as a calming 
									and sophisticated anchor amidst the brightness. Purple's mix of red and blue hints at both passion and serenity. The dark red-orange logo introduces
									 warmth and enthusiasm to the design. Together, these colors breathe 
									 fresh life into the app, creating a modern and engaging interface.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>I believe the first iteration is the most effective because it seamlessly integrates visual appeal with user-centric design. 
									While its distinct color palette captures attention, it also ensures that navigating through the app remains intuitive. 
									The design's emotional resonance, from the calming pastel to the invigorating orange, enhances user engagement. 
									Moreover, the clearly defined elements, like the standout app bar and the anchoring logo, prioritize user comfort and fluid interaction. 
									In essence, this iteration goes beyond mere aesthetics to offer an experience that's both delightful and functional for the intended audience.
									My definition of "effective" in the context of UI design hinges on two primary factors. First, there must be sufficient contrast between elements, 
									ensuring that users can effortlessly distinguish and navigate the interface's various components. 
									Such contrast not only promotes accessibility but also enhances user experience by minimizing confusion or potential missteps. 
									Second, the design must possess aesthetic appeal, resonating with the target audience and fostering a positive emotional connection. 
									An aesthetically pleasing design can significantly elevate user engagement and overall satisfaction.

								<h3>#ApproximateAnalogy </h3>
								<h4>Colors Workshop</h4>
								<p>
									
									<strong>Emotion is to color as intuition is to UI design.</strong><br>
									
									While color speaks to our emotions and helps set the tone or mood, an intuitive UI design speaks to our 
									innate understanding and ease of use. Both elements, when chosen and applied appropriately, contribute to a richer user experience.
									<br><br>
									As a future software engineer, I recognize that the analogy emphasizes the profound importance of user experience. 
									Beyond merely crafting functional code, I must appreciate the intertwining of emotion and intuitive design to produce 
									truly user-centric software. This understanding not only strengthens collaboration with design teams but also 
									positions me to develop software that resonates deeply with its users.

								<h3>#WordJournal </h3>
								<h4>Design Rules</h4>
								<p>
									The section I will be referring to is Chapter 5, Omit Needless Words: The Art of Not Writing for the Web. <br>
									
									<strong>Balance</strong><br>
									
									I chose the word "balance" because this section highlights the repercussions of excessive text on the page, while 
									also delving into user-centric priorities. Numerous webpages are laden with an abundance of extraneous text that fails to 
									pique the user's interest, merely occupying valuable space on the page without offering meaningful content. 
									Within this particular segment, the author Steve Krug addresses the advantages of eliminating unnecessary words, including the reduction of noise on the page, 
									the enhanced prominence of useful content, and the resulting shorter page length. This enables users to capture a more comprehensive 
									view of each page without the need for excessive scrolling. As a future software engineer with an interest in UI design, this information is very valuable to me.
									By establishing a balance between essential and non-essential text on a page, the result is an enriched user experience, streamlined navigation, 
									and optimized functionality of the software application. Attaining mastery in the "art of not writing for the web" will propel me 
									towards becoming a proficient designer of software and applications.

								<h3>#WordJournal </h3>
								<h4>Affordances & Signifiers II</h4>
								<p>
									The section I will be referring to is called "Falsely Blaming Yourself" from pages 65-68. <br>
									
									<strong>Accommodate</strong><br>
									
									I chose the word "accommodate" because this section brings to light the issue of humans adjusting to 
									machines without receiving the same accommodation in return. Interacting with machines does not always proceed as seamlessly as one might anticipate. 
									Therefore, it is essential to anticipate inappropriate actions by the user. As a future software engineer, it is important to 
									acknowledge that users cannot be expected to achieve flawless mastery over a system or software, as they aren't the ones who designed it. 
									By leveraging insights gained from user testing, software engineers can fine-tune their creations to align with user expectations, 
									making use of techniques such as affordances, signifiers, effective mapping, and well-defined constraints. This iterative process not only 
									enhances user satisfaction but also strengthens the bridge between human and machine interaction, fostering a more harmonious user experience. 
									Having this awareness will help serve as a driving force for my growth as a software engineer.
