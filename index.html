						<h3>Finding Inspiration</h3>
						<h4>Sand Spit</h4>
						<p>
							"Sand Spit" is a captivating oil on canvas painting created in 1957 by the renowned artist
							Milton Avery.
							Avery, recognized as America's leading colorist during his time, relocated to the New York
							City in 1925.
							In this artistic hub, he collaborated with and drew inspiration from notable painters such
							as Robert Henri, John Sloan, and Edward Hopper.
							In "Sand Spit," Avery's distinctive style is evident, with a focus on the relationships
							between forms and colors rather than detailed realism.
							Using a minimalist palette of about four colors, the painting portrays a tranquil seascape
							where a lush field converges with a prominent expanse
							of white spume. This piece reflects a phase in Avery's artistic journey when he gravitated
							towards landscapes and simplified interiors.
							Bridging European modernism and American Abstract Expressionism, "Sand Spit" encapsulates
							Avery's pioneering approach to art, where the
							essence of color overshadowed intricate detail.
							<br><br>
						<h4>Composition and Flow:</h4>
						<p>The composition of "Sand Spit" is structured in layers, each representing a different
							element of the coastal landscape. The transition from the sky to the pastures, then to the
							spume and sandy path, and finally to the water, creates a sense of depth and perspective.
							This layered approach guides the viewer's gaze through the painting, offering a journey from
							the expansive sky to the tranquil water below.</p>
						<h4>Color Balance</h4>
						<p>"Sand Spit" displays a harmonious blend of colors: the light blue of the sky, a lighter green
							pasture interspersed with patches of darker green, the dominant white of the spume, the
							sandy beige of the path, and the brighter shade of blue for the water.
							Avery's expertise as a colorist shines through in the way these colors come together to
							evoke the ambiance of a coastal landscape.</p>
						<h4>Texture and Detail:</h4>
						<p>The presence of darker green patches within the lighter green pasture adds a sense of texture
							and depth to the painting. While they may resemble bushes, their abstract nature leaves room
							for interpretation, allowing viewers to engage with the painting and form their own
							perceptions. These subtle variations in color and form enrich the landscape, inviting a
							deeper exploration and appreciation of Avery's artistic nuances.</p>
						</p>
						<h4>My inspired UI:</h4>
						<img src="images/oceanom.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
						<p> The UI is a screen from the "Ocean Om" app, designed with a calming oceanic theme. The top
							of the screen features the "Ocean Om" logo in a soothing light blue, followed by a darker
							blue header labeled "Meditation Station". Beneath this header, there's a beige sandy-colored
							section titled "Choose Soundscape", where users can select their preferred oceanic sounds
							from a menu. Further down, there's a vibrant green button labeled "Start Meditation",
							inviting users to begin their meditative journey. The bottom of the screen has a blue app
							bar, and the entire background of the app is adorned with serene blue ocean waves,
							encapsulating the user in a tranquil maritime ambiance. The UI is intended for mobile
							devices, such as smartphones and tablets.</p>
						<br>
						<p>The inspiration for this UI sketch is drawn from the tranquil and layered visuals of the
							"Sand Spit" painting by Milton Avery. The color palette, with its gradation from light blue
							to sandy beige and then to vibrant green, mirrors the layered colors of the painting. The
							ocean waves background further immerses users in a calming coastal environment, reminiscent
							of the serene seascape depicted in "Sand Spit". The design aims to transport users to a
							peaceful oceanic realm, facilitating a deeper and more connected meditation experience.</p>

						<p>

							<strong>Advice</strong><br>

							I chose the word "advice" because the article emphasizes the use of the word "advice" over
							"feedback"
							due to the negative connotations commonly associated with the latter. Most people tend to
							associate feedback
							with criticism, which can make both giving and receiving feedback uncomfortable. By asking
							for advice instead
							of feedback, it is perceived as an invitation, signaling that the advice giver has valuable
							expertise or knowledge,
							making the interaction more positive and constructive. This subtle shift in terminology can
							foster a more open and
							collaborative environment, where team members feel more comfortable sharing their insights
							and suggestions,
							ultimately contributing to the professional growth of individuals and the improvement of
							design outcomes.

							As a future software engineer, it is important to understand that feedback and advice are
							crucial in this field
							for fostering innovation and continuous improvement in this fast-paced field. They
							facilitate collaboration and
							knowledge exchange, which are essential for creating optimal solutions. Additionally, they
							are

						<h4>Mockups</h4>
						<p>

							After reading the segment in which Steve Krug, the author, dissects the home pages of two
							websites and offers
							his recommendations, I felt motivated to undertake a similar assessment of the Alani Nu
							website's homepage.


							<br><br>
						<h5>Screen shots of the home page with my own markups: </h5>

						<img src="images/alaninu1.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
						<img src="images/alaninu2.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
						<img src="images/alaninu3.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
						<br><br>
						If I could redesign this homepage, I would first change the tagline. "Here for you and your
						taste buds" seems too broad.
						It leaves me asking, "in what way is this here for me?" I would change it to "Nourishing your
						wellness journey deliciously", which
						makes it clear that the website offers products related to health and wellness that are also
						tasty. I would also put the blurb about their
						mission below the tagline and remove the "Shop All" button as there is already one in the
						section below. The section below the hero section
						has a header labeled "What wellness should taste like" to the left of its content. At first, I
						thought there was a layout error with my
						browser, but I believe it is intentional. I would put the header above the content. I would also
						make the product "cards" smaller to eliminate
						the need to scroll horizontally, as there are only 5 "cards".
						<br>
						While the improvements made during this exercise will not be implemented on the website being
						analyzed, the process itself is a valuable
						learning experience that can enhance a software engineer's skill set, creativity, and
						understanding of user-centric design. It also
						contributes to a culture of continuous improvement and innovation within the field.

						<h3>#DirectedAnalysis </h3>
						<h4>Design Systems</h4>
						<p>

							Typography is pivotal in design, often making up to 90% of a screen's content. When
							selecting typefaces,
							it's vital to balance brand identity, on-screen clarity, and performance, sometimes opting
							for system-native
							fonts for speed. The choice of font weights and styles should focus on clear hierarchies,
							minimizing variations
							for efficiency. Font sizes and line-heights, typically starting with a 1.5x ratio, are
							intertwined and play a
							role in the design's overall grid, needing adaptability across devices. It's essential to
							encode these typographic
							elements systematically for ease of maintenance and responsiveness.
						</p>
						<img src="images/myred.png" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
						<p>
							MyRed's user interface (UI) is a good example of effective typography in web design.
							The platform establishes a clear typographical hierarchy, with each section introduced by
							well-proportioned headers.
							Notably, these headers utilize a readable typeface that contrasts with the content typeface,
							effectively distinguishing between headers and content for improved clarity and emphasis.
							The content itself employs another readable typeface, ensuring legibility. Furthermore,
							MyRed's typography
							is adaptable, showing consistent responsiveness across different device sizes. In essence,
							MyRed's
							design balances aesthetics with user-centric functionality through its thoughtful
							typographical choices.

						<h3>Color Study</h3>
						<p>
							I undertook the task of analyzing the color scheme of a specific UI: the Campus Cash app,
							designed to provide students with coupon offers.
							My initial step involved recreating the UI, preserving its original color palette to clearly
							highlight the functionality associated
							with each hue. My goal was to enhance the effectiveness of the design by consolidating more
							content within a singular screen size.
							Following this, I crafted three additional versions, each with a unique color scheme. The
							most demanding aspect of this exercise was
							striving for a balance between aesthetic appeal and clear distinction between interface
							elements. Concluding the project, I performed
							a detailed analysis of each proposed color arrangement. Below are the results of this
							exercise.
						</p>
						<h4>This is a page from the Campus Cash app, which is an app with coupons for students.</h4>
						<img src="images/campuscash.png" style="width: 20%; height: auto;">
						<p>The app’s theme is monochromatic. It uses different shades of green. The blend of green
							shades imparts a harmonious feel, as the hues complement one another
							and aid in distinguishing between different elements. Because of its monochromatic theme,
							the app might pose accessibility challenges.
							Monochromatic color schemes, while aesthetically appealing, can sometimes lead to
							insufficient contrast between different design elements.
							Users with visual impairments, especially those with color vision deficiencies, might find
							it difficult to distinguish between various parts of the interface.
							This can impact not only the readability of the text but also the user's ability to identify
							actionable items. I believe the designers were trying to make a
							simple app that is intuitive and straight forward for college students. The decision to use
							green might have multiple reasons behind it; green often symbolizes growth,
							and renewal. It can also be associated with financial wellness or eco-friendliness, which
							fits with the purpose of the app.
						</p>
						<img src="images/pinkcc.png" style="width: 20%; height: auto;">
						<p>
							This iteration of the UI employs a near split-complementary color scheme, featuring a
							red-purple hue (resulting in a pinkish tone), orange, and green.
							The UI boasts a calming pastel backdrop, setting a welcoming atmosphere. Dominating this is
							the orange app bar,
							infusing the design with enthusiasm. Orange's liveliness keeps users engaged amidst the
							soothing background.
							The dark pine green logo anchors the interface, conveying stability and depth. Its richness
							contrasts with the energetic orange,
							ensuring balance. Strategically, the logo foregrounds the brand's reliability. Together, the
							colors harmonize tranquility
							with dynamism, crafting a refreshing yet grounded design.
						</p>
						<img src="images/neutralcc.png" style="width: 20%; height: auto;">
						<p>
							Although the this redesigned UI does not fit into a harmonious combination, it features a
							serene pastel blue app bar,
							exuding calm and clarity. This shade fosters a user-friendly ambiance. Contrasting this is
							the dark tan, lending an earthy,
							stable foundation to the interface. Its neutrality anchors the design without overwhelming.
							The bright orange logo stands out,
							adding a splash of vitality and enthusiasm. Collectively,
							this palette melds soft sophistication with energetic vibrancy, crafting an inviting design.
						</p>
						<img src="images/tealcc.png" style="width: 20%; height: auto;">
						<p>This iteration of the UI closely aligns with a split-complementary color scheme,
							incorporating shades of blue-green, blue-purple, and red-orange.
							The bright blue-green background offers a refreshing and invigorating base, capturing
							attention and evoking feelings of growth and creativity.
							This vibrancy likely resonates with the energetic nature of college students. The
							bluish-purple app bar contrasts beautifully, serving as a calming
							and sophisticated anchor amidst the brightness. Purple's mix of red and blue hints at both
							passion and serenity. The dark red-orange logo introduces
							warmth and enthusiasm to the design. Together, these colors breathe
							fresh life into the app, creating a modern and engaging interface.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>I believe the first iteration is the most effective because it seamlessly integrates visual
							appeal with user-centric design.
							While its distinct color palette captures attention, it also ensures that navigating through
							the app remains intuitive.
							The design's emotional resonance, from the calming pastel to the invigorating orange,
							enhances user engagement.
							Moreover, the clearly defined elements, like the standout app bar and the anchoring logo,
							prioritize user comfort and fluid interaction.
							In essence, this iteration goes beyond mere aesthetics to offer an experience that's both
							delightful and functional for the intended audience.
							My definition of "effective" in the context of UI design hinges on two primary factors.
							First, there must be sufficient contrast between elements,
							ensuring that users can effortlessly distinguish and navigate the interface's various
							components.
							Such contrast not only promotes accessibility but also enhances user experience by
							minimizing confusion or potential missteps.
							Second, the design must possess aesthetic appeal, resonating with the target audience and
							fostering a positive emotional connection.
							An aesthetically pleasing design can significantly elevate user engagement and overall
							satisfaction.

							The section I will be referring to is called "Falsely Blaming Yourself" from pages 65-68.

							<strong>Accommodate</strong><br>

							I chose the word "accommodate" because this section brings to light the issue of humans
							adjusting to
							machines without receiving the same accommodation in return. Interacting with machines does
							not always proceed as seamlessly as one might anticipate.
							Therefore, it is essential to anticipate inappropriate actions by the user. As a future
							software engineer, it is important to
							acknowledge that users cannot be expected to achieve flawless mastery over a system or
							software, as they aren't the ones who designed it.
							By leveraging insights gained from user testing, software engineers can fine-tune their
							creations to align with user expectations,
							making use of techniques such as affordances, signifiers, effective mapping, and
							well-defined constraints. This iterative process not only
							enhances user satisfaction but also strengthens the bridge between human and machine
							interaction, fostering a more harmonious user experience.
							Having this awareness will help serve as a driving force for my growth as a software
							engineer.

							<strong>Experience</strong><br>

							I chose the word "experience" to summarize this section because Don Norman, the author,
							highlights the significance of the user's experience. A user's experience impacts their
							satisfaction with the product, as well as their inclination to continue using and
							recommending it.
							This, in turn, plays a pivotal role in determining the overall success of the product. As a
							future software engineer,
							I recognize the importance of creating products and services that deliver a satisfying user
							experience.
							Hence, there are many steps that a software engineer can take to ensure user satisfaction.
							From the initial phase of requirements elicitation through the meticulous stages of user
							testing,
							meeting the expectations of the customer and providing a satisfying user experience will
							help lay the
							foundation for my journey towards becoming a successful software engineer.
