            <h3>#WordJournal </h3>
            <h4>Design Rules</h4>
            <p>
                The section I will be referring to is Chapter 5, Omit Needless Words: The Art of Not Writing
                for the Web. <br>

                <strong>Balance</strong><br>

                I chose the word "balance" because this section highlights the repercussions of excessive
                text on the page, while
                also delving into user-centric priorities. Numerous webpages are laden with an abundance of
                extraneous text that fails to
                pique the user's interest, merely occupying valuable space on the page without offering
                meaningful content.
                Within this particular segment, the author Steve Krug addresses the advantages of
                eliminating unnecessary words, including the reduction of noise on the page,
                the enhanced prominence of useful content, and the resulting shorter page length. This
                enables users to capture a more comprehensive
                view of each page without the need for excessive scrolling. As a future software engineer
                with an interest in UI design, this information is very valuable to me.
                By establishing a balance between essential and non-essential text on a page, the result is
                an enriched user experience, streamlined navigation,
                and optimized functionality of the software application. Attaining mastery in the "art of
                not writing for the web" will propel me
                towards becoming a proficient designer of software and applications.
